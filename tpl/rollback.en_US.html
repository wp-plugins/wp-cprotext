<p class='title'>WP-CPROTEXT DATABASE UPGRADE FAILED</p>
<p>
  This upgrade of WP-CPROTEXT plugin required a database upgrade. For some reasons, this process was unabled to be achieved successfully.
</p>
<p>
  However, the database was restored to its previous state, before this failed upgrade.
  Your WP-CPROTEXT installation is now in an intermediary state where the plugin is up-to-date, but the database corresponds to a previous version.
</p>
<p>
  In order to insure your data safety, the text protection tools will not be available anymore from the edition page until you downgrade this plugin to the version installed before this failed upgrade.
