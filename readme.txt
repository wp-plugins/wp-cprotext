CPROTEXT protects your texts from being hijacked using a process that
nullifies in-browser copy/paste as well as HTML code parsing by web
crawlers.

== Description ==

CPROTEXT is an online service for copyright protection that you
can experiment by visiting the example page of [CPROTEXT
website](http://www.cprotext.com "CPROTEXT: Copyright protection for
online texts").

WP-CPROTEXT offers the opportunity to protect your published texts
from any kind of digital copy, being in-browser copy/paste or HTML code parsing
by web crawlers. When you decide to protect and publish a text in
WordPress, it is first submitted to the CPROTEXT online service to be
processed. The returned data are then stored in your WordPress database
in addition to the original text. These data are used to display a copy
protected version of your original text.

Once stored, __the protected text data are forever yours, independently
of the CPROTEXT online service__. You can then choose to enable or
disable protection at will.

As explained in [CPROTEXT FAQ](http://www.cprotext.com/en/faq.html), the
protected text data returned by the CPROTEXT online service are only
composed of standard HTML and CSS, and do not require JavaScript code to
be effective. Therefore, contrary to other copy protection plugins, the
CPROTEXT protection is engraved in the web page and can not be removed
by disabling browser JavaScript support. Altering the protected text
data would result in a randomly modified text to be displayed.

To improve the SEO rank of your text web page, you are able to fill in a
placeholder text that will be available to web crawlers such as search
engines. It can either be an abstract of your content, the first lines
of your text, or whatever keywords you would like to make available
to search engines so that your content is efficiently referenced. This
placeholder text will also be displayed by browsers that are not able
to display your protected text because of incomplete support of web
standards. It can then be used to inform their users about the 
purpose of your protected text.

The WP-CPROTEXT Settings page offers you several options:
1. How to notify your readers about the protection applied to your text
1. Which font to use to display your text ( cf. CPROTEXT F.A.Q. )
